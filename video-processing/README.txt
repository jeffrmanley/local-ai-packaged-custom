What This Code Does
/loop-video (POST):

Accepts JSON input (type, background URL, media list, duration).

Spawns a background thread to do the FFmpeg/MoviePy work.

Returns a job_id so the client can poll progress.

process_loop_video() (background thread):

Downloads the background music and each media file.

Concatenates or loops them to match the requested duration.

Overlays the background audio if provided.

Saves the final MP4 file.

Updates jobs[job_id] with status (done or error) and the path to the final file.

/progress/<job_id> (GET):

Returns the current status: pending, in-progress, done, or error.

/download/<job_id> (GET):

If the job is done, sends back the final MP4 file as a download.

With this, you can replicate the flow of:

(1) Start video generation (loop-video endpoint).

(2) Check progress (progress/<job_id>).

(3) Download final output (download/<job_id>).

Integrate with n8n
Call POST /loop-video in an n8n HTTP Request node to start a job.

Body includes type, data.background_url, data.media_list, and data.duration.

The response returns a JSON with data.id (the job_id).

Poll the progress in a subsequent node or loop in your workflow:

GET /progress/<job_id> until the status is done (or a timeout).

Download the final video by calling GET /download/<job_id> once status is done.

In n8n, set the HTTP Request node to File response format to capture the binary file.
